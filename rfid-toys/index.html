      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>Radio frequency identification now belongs to the masses, and it lets you control all
         sorts of things. Like access to your front door. Or valuables in an RFID-enabled safe.
         You can corral your stuff within an RFID-monitored perimeter, or build a shelf that tells
         you when you're out of hot sauce. This book shows you how, with step-by-step instructions,
         illustrations, photos, and a list of the tools and technology you need for every project.
         It even supplies the lowdown on read/write tags and - for the truly extreme - implantable chips.</p>
